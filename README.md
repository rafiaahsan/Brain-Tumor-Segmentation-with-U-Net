# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-with-U-Net
This repository demonstrates 2D medical image segmentation using a U-Net architecture. Built with TensorFlow/Keras, it provides a complete workflow for biomedical image analysis.

**Description:**

This repository showcases the complete workflow of 2D medical image segmentation using the deep learning architecture. The goal is to automatically segment tumor regions from medical images, a crucial step in computer-aided diagnosis and medical imaging analysis.

**Key Highlights:**

-Dataset: Medical images with annotated tumor masks (not included in this repo — you may use BraTS or any MRI dataset).

-Model Architecture: Implemented a U-Net — a widely used deep learning model for biomedical image segmentation.

-Training Parameters: Configured key hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, loss function, optimizer).

-Predictions: Generated segmentation masks to highlight tumor regions in 2D slices.

-Evaluation: Visual inspection of predictions alongside ground-truth annotations.

Feel free to explore this repository to gain insights into the field of medical image analysis, deep learning, and computer vision. Whether you’re a researcher, machine learning enthusiast, or someone curious about the applications of AI in healthcare, this project offers practical knowledge and useful resources.
